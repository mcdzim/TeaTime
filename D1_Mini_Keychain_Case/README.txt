# Summary

I wanted a simple, rugged keychain case to carry around a Wemos D1 Mini board.  So after a Saturday afternoon of playing in TinkerCAD and test printing, I finally came up with this.

It's nothing fancy. It has moderate clearance around the USB receptacle and the reset button can be pressed with something like a pen.

I included two versions... the solid version and the vented version.  You can use either base with either cap so print whatever you want.

UPDATE 2017-09-27:
I have uploaded a new version of the design.  This one includes a stronger connector and has the wifi logo embedded in the base and the cap.
